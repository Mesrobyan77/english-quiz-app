  { "id": "2", "english": "world", "translated": "’°’∑’≠’°÷Ä’∞" }

Use a separate component or manually set via localStorage.setItem("words", JSON.stringify([...])).


Play the Quiz:

Select translation direction (English ‚Üí Armenian or Armenian ‚Üí English).
Listen to words using the speaker icon (English only).
Enter translations and submit to receive feedback.
Correct answers trigger confetti and a sound effect; incorrect answers play a buzzer.
Adjust speech rate, voice, sound volume, or toggle sounds via settings.
